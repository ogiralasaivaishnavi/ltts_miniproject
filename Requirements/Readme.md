## Introduction
 Traffic light which is one of vital public facilities plays an important role to the road user, which is used to control traffic flows at the busy intersection.
 Traffic light system consists of two parts, first part is traffic light and the second part is controller unit. 
 The first four-way, three-color traffic light was created by police officer William Potts in Detroit, Michigan in 1920. Moyer, Sheldon (March 1947). In 1922, T.E. Hayes patented his "Combination traffic guide and traffic regulating signal" (Patent#1447659)                     

## Research
The traffic lights consist of a set of three coloured lights: red, yellow and green. 
In a typical cycle, 
1. Illumination of the green light allows traffic to proceed in the direction denoted.
2. Illumination of the amber/yellow light denoting, if safe to do so, prepare to stop short of the intersection, and 
3. Illumination of the red signal prohibits any traffic from proceeding.

## Defining Our System
coming to our system, it has 5 modes of operation. For a particular input variable given to the system , the particular green light on that particular road is ON putting all the red lights on remaining roads ON and Green lights OFF. 
For input is equal to 'a', the automatic mode is ON where the traffic lights are contionously changed in the loop until some external input is given.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

-> Roads where heavy traffic is present. 

## What:

-> It becomes difficult to control the heavy traffic in 4-way cross roads.This control is efficient in controlling traffic.

## When:

-> The problem is long delay time and chance of more number of accidents.

## Where:

-> All heavy crowded roads in cities.

## How:

-> The problem can lead to wastage of human time. The system helps in fast removal of heavy traffic.
